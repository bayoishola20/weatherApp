# Ionic Application
A simple mobile app built with Ionic 3 and Angular 4. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## To use:
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bayoishola20/weatherApp.git`

* `npm install`

* `ionic serve` | `ionic serve -l`


## You should have installed (most recent versions):

* NodeJS
* Ionic and Ionic CLI

## Some cool stuff implemented:

* Pull to refresh
* Local storage


THIS IS A BETA VERSION WITH LOTS OF CHANGES STILL NEEDED.

Inspired by the awesome @bradtraversy.

### PS:
* API consumption; hence, no custom backend.
